# Django Project Structure with HTML

This README provides an overview of the typical structure of a Django project with HTML templates. Django is a powerful web framework for building web applications using Python. In this project structure, we'll focus on integrating HTML templates into our Django application.

## Project Structure

The Django project structure typically consists of the following directories and files:

```
my_project/
|-- my_app/
|   |-- migrations/
|   |-- static/
|   |-- templates/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- admin.py
|   |-- apps.py
|   |-- models.py
|   |-- tests.py
|   |-- views.py
|-- my_project/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- asgi.py
|   |-- settings.py
|   |-- urls.py
|   |-- wsgi.py
|-- manage.py
|-- requirements.txt
```

### Explanation of directories and files:

1. `my_project`: This is the root directory of the Django project and is usually named after your project. This directory contains settings, URL configurations, and other project-related files.

2. `my_app`: This is one of the Django apps within the project. You can have multiple apps to organize different parts of your project. Each app contains its own models, views, templates, and static files.

3. `migrations`: This directory contains database migration files. Django uses these files to manage changes to your database schema.

4. `static`: This directory is used to store static files like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. It should be organized into subdirectories based on the file type or purpose.

5. `templates`: This directory holds all HTML templates used in your app. Django's template engine allows you to use template tags and filters to generate dynamic content.

6. `__init__.py`: An empty file that designates a directory as a Python package.

7. `admin.py`: This file is used to register models for the Django admin interface.

8. `apps.py`: Configuration file for the app, where you can define app-specific settings.

9. `models.py`: This file defines your app's database models using Django's model system.

10. `tests.py`: You can write test cases for your app in this file.

11. `views.py`: This file contains the views or controllers for your app, where you define how data is presented and processed.

12. `asgi.py` and `wsgi.py`: These files are used for ASGI and WSGI servers, respectively, for deploying Django applications.

13. `urls.py`: This file defines URL patterns and maps them to views.

14. `manage.py`: A command-line utility for managing Django projects. It allows you to run development servers, create database tables, run tests, and more.

15. `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies required for your project. You can use it to set up the project environment.

## Getting Started

To start using this Django project structure with HTML templates, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this project to your local machine.

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. Set up the database by running `python manage.py migrate`.

5. Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface with `python manage.py createsuperuser`.

6. Run the development server with `python manage.py runserver`.

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see your Django application in action.

Feel free to customize this project structure to fit your specific needs. Happy coding!
